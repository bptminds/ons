Boot Start
==========

This is a Grails starter project based on the Twitter Bootstrap, Less CSS, and Fields plugins. It also replaces the default scaffolding templates with Bootstrap-based versions to provid a more modern default UI.

Usage
-----

Simply clone the project, rename the root directory, and change the `app.name` property in `application.properties`. You may also want to remove the test controllers and domain classes.
